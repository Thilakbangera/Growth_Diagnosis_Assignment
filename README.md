##  Features

### Part 1: Bottleneck Diagnosis
- Structured AI dialogue prompts to uncover bottlenecks across three critical layers:
  - **Mindset** â€“ Founderâ€™s mental model
  - **Systemic** â€“ Talent/process capability
  - **Strategic** â€“ Pricing and market clarity
- Each prompt includes a tailored positive AI prompt and a "negative prompt" to avoid unwanted suggestions.
- Uses Cialdini Principles (Consistency, Authority, Social Proof) to frame insights.

### Part 2: Growth Readiness Scorecard
- Mini-assessment highlighting bottlenecks and corresponding experimental solutions.
- AI prompts simulate outcomes (e.g., delegation frameworks, CRM workflows, pricing tier experiments).
- Bottlenecks are mapped to **Growth OS stages** for clarity.

### Part 3: Strategic Summary
- Synthesizes insights into actionable learnings:
  - Distinguish symptoms from root causes.
  - Growth consulting spans mindset, process, and strategic clarity.
  - Roles: **Coach**, **Analyst**, **Operator** â€” with AI as co-pilot.
